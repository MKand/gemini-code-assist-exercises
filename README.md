# Gemini Code Assist: A Hands-On Guide

This repository is a collection of challenges designed to showcase the capabilities of Gemini Code Assist, a powerful AI-powered coding assistant. It's not an official Google Cloud repository, but rather a custom-made project to demonstrate the potential of Gemini Code Assist in real-world coding scenarios.

Solutions can be found in the `solutions` branch of the repository. But, it is recommended that you find the solutions yourself by playing with Code Assist.

## Challenge Sets

This repository contains two challenge sets:

**Set 1: Superheroes and Villains Data Challenges**

This set focuses on data manipulation and transformation using Python. You'll work with a JSON file containing information about superheroes, villains, and their locations. The challenges involve:

* Loading and validating JSON data
* Filtering data based on specific criteria
* Transforming data using regular expressions
* Creating new data structures from existing data

View the [challenge.md](set1/challenge.md) file for detailed instructions.

**Set 2: Get to know Gemini code Assist**

This set focuses on building a simple web application using Flask and Gemini Code Assist. You'll learn how to:

* Use Gemini Code Assist to understand and debug code
* Integrate a Gemini image processing Cloud Function into your application
* Improve the user interface of your application using HTML and CSS

View the [challenge.md](set2/challenge.md) file for detailed instructions.
